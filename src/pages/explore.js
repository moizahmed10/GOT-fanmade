                <h1>Westeros</h1>
                <p>
                  Westeros is bordered to the west by the Sunset Sea, to the
                  south by the Summer Sea and to the east by the Narrow Sea and
                  Shivering Sea. The northern edges of the continent have not
                  been charted, but are believed to extend to the northern polar
                  ice cap. The continent shares similar geography and geometry
                  to the real-life isle of Great Britain, and is narrow, about
                  900 miles wide at its widest point, but long, extending for
                  almost 2,000 miles from the Summer Sea to the Wall that marks
                  the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms. The extent of the
                  wildling lands beyond the Wall are unknown. The continent's
                  terrain varies immensely. There are significant mountain
                  ranges, such as the Mountains of the Moon in the Vale of
                  Arryn, the Red Mountains of Dorne and the Frostfangs. There
                  are also several extensive river networks, most notably the
                  Trident and its numerous tributaries, but also the Blackwater
                  Rush, the White Knife, the Mander, and the Greenblood. The
                  climate varies between extremes of heat and cold across the
                  large continentThe North is the only region in which snowfall
                  is common, even in the middle of the years-long "summers".
                  Beyond the Wall the temperature becomes even lower and
                  hostile, forming the taiga woodlands of the Haunted Forest,

                <p>
                  The Kingdom of the North is the name given to an independent
                  realm that controls the northern territories of the continent
                  of Westeros, north of the Six Kingdoms. It is named after the
                  North, one of the nine distinct regions of Westeros and the
                  largest and most prominent in the kingdom. The kingdom is
                  ruled by the King or Queen in the North, typically the head of
                  House Stark, from their seat at Winterfell. Ruled by House
                  Stark from the castle of Winterfell. Bastards of noble birth
                  born in the North take the surname "Snow". The principal port
                  and city of the North is White Harbor. The North is the
                  largest of the regions of Westeros but also the most
                  sparsely-populated, due the harshness of the long winter. The
                  North also includes the Wall and the lands administered by the
                  Night's Watch, which are technically independent but are
                  almost always thought of in conjunction with the North. The
                  North is the only region in Westeros to govern itself
                  independently of the King of the Andals and First Men.

                <h1>The Vale of Arryn</h1>
                <p>
                  The Vale of Arryn, often referred to simply as the Vale, is
                  one of the constituent regions of the Six Kingdoms. Prior to
                  the War of Conquest, it was a sovereign nation known as the
                  Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale. It is ruled by House
                  Arryn from their stronghold, the Eyrie. Protected and
                  surrounded by the Mountains of the Moon, the Vale is isolated
                  from the rest of Westeros and is accessible only during warmer
                  seasons.[1] Bastards born in the Vale are given the surname
                  Stone. The Vale is where the Andals first landed and assailed
                  from during their invasion of Westeros six thousand years ago,
                  though as settlement patterns became established, the Reach
                  became the main population center and cultural heartland of
                  the Andals. Still, because of its isolated, mountainous
                  terrain, noble families from the Vale are said to have among
                  the purest Andal bloodlines within Westeros. While some other
                  noble families on the continent can claim the same, the Vale
                  is unique to this as a region.

                  Ruled by House Tully from the castle of Riverrun. Bastards of
                  noble birth born in the Riverlands take the surname "Rivers".
                  The principal ports of the Riverlands are Seagard, Saltpans
                  and Maidenpool. Notable towns include Stoney Sept. The
                  Riverlands are dominated by the mighty River Trident and its
                  numerous tributaries, including the Tumblestone. The
                  Riverlands, lying close to the center of the continent, have
                  been the site for battles and conflicts throughout the history
                  of Westeros. Once an independent kingdom, they were overrun by
                  the ironborn a century before Aegon's invasion and are thus
                  not counted as an eighth kingdom, despite their significant
                  size and population. The Riverlands are, as their name
                  suggests, one of the most fertile and populous regions in
                  Westeros, which is in many ways the only reason they have been
                  consistently able to recover from the frequent wars that cross
                  their borders.

                <h1>The Iron Islands</h1>
                <p>
                  The Iron Islands is one of the nine constituent regions of
                  Westeros. They are a cluster of seven small, rocky islands off
                  the western coast of the continent, in Ironman's Bay. The Iron
                  Islands are ruled from the castle of Pyke by House Greyjoy.
                  The islands are the smallest and one of the least-populous
                  regions of Westeros, but the naval skills of their people, the
                  ironborn, are unmatched and they enjoy great mobility due to
                  their ships. The ironborn also have a unique culture and
                  religion, centered on maritime raiding and pillaging other
                  peoples, that sets them apart from mainland Westeros. However,
                  they were forced to stop these practices following the War of
                  Conquest, or at least to stop raiding around Westeros itself.
                  Although this edict was not always effectively enforced by the
                  Iron Throne, Daenerys Targaryen reinstated it as a condition
                  of the Iron Islands regaining independent rule nearly 300
                  years later.

                  The Crownlands is one of the nine constituent regions of the
                  Seven Kingdoms. Instead of being ruled by a Lord Paramount,
                  the Crownlands are ruled directly by the monarch on the Iron
                  Throne from the city of King's Landing, the largest city in
                  Westeros and the capital of the Seven Kingdoms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Crownlands were never a sovereign nation, instead being
                  contested between the Riverlands, the Stormlands, and other
                  regions for thousands of years until Aegon the Conqueror
                  seized control of the area during his invasion and made it his
                  primary foothold on the continent, three centuries before the
                  death of King Robert Baratheon. It is therefore the newest of
                  the regions in Westeros, and as a result, does not have much
                  of a distinct "cultural identity", so much as it is shaped by
                  its distinction as the region containing the capital city.

                <h1>The Stormlands</h1>
                <p>
                  The Stormlands is one of the nine constituent regions of the
                  Seven Kingdoms. It is located on the south east coast of the
                  continent of Westeros, on the shores of the Narrow Sea, south
                  of the Crownlands and north of Dorne. The Stormlands are
                  traditionally ruled from the castle of Storm's End, formerly
                  by House Baratheon. They are so-named for the savage and
                  frequent storms from the Narrow Sea that batter the coast. It
                  was originally a sovereign nation known as the Storm Kingdom,
                  until Aegon the Conqueror united Westeros under his rule. When
                  Aegon Targaryen and his army invaded Westeros during the War
                  of Conquest, Aegon sent his bastard half-brother Orys
                  Baratheon to secure the Stormlands. The Storm King, Argilac
                  the Arrogant, could have withstood siege indefinitely within
                  Storm's End's mighty walls, but chose instead to give battle.
                  He was defeated and killed. Storm's End surrendered and Aegon
                  ennobled Orys, giving him Argilac's lands, castle and daughter
                  to rule. House Baratheon continued to rule the Stormlands for
                  the next three centuries, up to the time of Robert's
                  Rebellion, when it became the royal family and split in three
                  branches; one controlling the capital and the Crownlands, one
                  controlling Dragonstone and nearby islands and one remaining
                  in the ancestral lands.

                  The Reach is one of the administrative regions of the Seven
                  Kingdoms, and was formerly a sovereign nation known as the
                  Kingdom of the Reach before the Targaryen conquest.
                  Geographically, it is one of the larger regions of the Seven
                  Kingdoms, ranking as the second largest in area, behind only
                  the vastness of the North. It has been ruled by House Tyrell
                  since the Conquest, and earlier than that by the Kings of
                  House Gardener. It is the most fertile part of Westeros,
                  blessed with vast, blooming fields of crops and flowers, and
                  numerous and well-populated villages and towns; it
                  traditionally helps supply other less fertile parts of the
                  Seven Kingdoms (most notably King's Landing) with grain,
                  fruit, wine and livestock. The Reach is also the most
                  heavily-populated part of Westeros and is one of the richest,
                  second only to the Westerlands, ruled by House Lannister.
                  However this claim is suggested to be rather outdated as
                  Lannister gold mines—the source of their wealth—have dried
                  out, and have been weakened by the War of the Five Kings, thus
                  making the Reach actually the wealthiest region. Due to this,
                  the Tyrells could traditionally field the largest army in the
                  Seven Kingdoms, almost as large as the armies from two of the
                  other populous kingdoms combined. This vast supply of
                  manpower, land, and food production gives the Reach enormous
                  strategic value during the War of the Five Kings.

                <h1>Principality of Dorne</h1>
                <p>
                  Dorne is one of the nine constituent regions of the Seven
                  Kingdoms. It is the southernmost part of the continent of
                  Westeros, located thousands of miles from Winterfell and the
                  North, and has a harsh desert climate. The Dornishmen are
                  ethnically distinct from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, being
                  largely descended from Rhoynar refugees who intermarried with
                  the local population of Andals and First Men roughly a
                  thousand years ago. As a result, they have very different
                  customs and traditions compared to the other regions of
                  Westeros. Dorne was a sovereign kingdom before the invasion of
                  Aegon the Conqueror, and weathered his attack to remain one
                  afterwards, the only one of the Seven Kingdoms to retain its
                  independence. It joined the Seven Kingdoms through peaceful
                  marriage alliance nearly two centuries later, only one century
                  before Robert's Rebellion. As a result of joining through
                  marriage and not conquest, Dorne was allowed to keep many of
                  its local customs and laws, such as equal inheritance laws for
                  male and female heirs. Due to these different ethnic, legal,
                  and political factors, the Dornishmen are very independently
                  minded, with a stronger sense of "national identity" than many
                  of the other Seven Kingdoms.

                <h1>Beyond the Wall</h1>
                <p>
                  Beyond the Wall is a generic term employed by the people of
                  the Six Kingdoms and the Kingdom of the North to refer to the
                  large area of Westeros that lies north of the Wall. It is the
                  only part of the continent that is not part of a realm, and
                  thus the only place where particular attention is given to the
                  difference between "Westeros" (the continent), and "the Six
                  Kingdoms" and the Kingdom of the North (the two realms to the
                  south of the Wall). It is inhabited by tribes that refer to
                  themselves as the "Free Folk", known by the people of the Six
                  Kingdoms as wildlings. The wildlings themselves are not
                  politically unified but consist of numerous and diverse
                  groups. Many are semi-nomadic hunters, due to the
                  impracticality of agriculture in the far north. Some wildlings
                  are little more than savage and primitive raiders, but other
                  groups live in small settled communities and villages.
